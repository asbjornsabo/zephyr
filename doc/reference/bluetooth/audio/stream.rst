Stream Control API
##################

The Bluetooth Audio Stream Control API provides functionality for managing the
audio streams.

Unicast
*******

Unicast topology :option:`CONFIG_BT_AUDIO_UNICAST` uses Isochronous Channels
:option:`CONFIG_BT_ISO` to establish a point-to-point connection.

Unicast depends in two services, Published Audio Capabilities Service (PACS)
:option:`CONFIG_BT_PACS` which exposes the audio codec capabilities and Audio
Stream Control Service (ASCS) :option:`CONFIG_BT_ASCS` that exposes Audio
Stream Endpoints (ASE) which can be used to configure audio streams.

Shell
*****

Basic Audio Profile (BAP) :option:`CONFIG_BT_BAP` shell module implements
commands corresponding to the procedures available in the BAP specification.
TODO: Add link to BAP specification.
